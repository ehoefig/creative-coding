# Creative Coding
Some experiments with generative design and creative coding.
Should be mostly in [p5.js](https://p5js.org) and [Processing](https://processing.org). Feel free to re-use.

## Experiments
 - *bootstrap*: Boilerplate code for starting p5.js projects
 - *flower*: Growing vines (p5.js)
 - *foundation*: Standard starting points for p5.js sketches (custom index.html)
 - *datashadow*: Shadow landscape from statistical data (Processing, Blender)
